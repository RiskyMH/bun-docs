Use `bun feedback` to share feedback, bug reports, and feature requests directly with the Bun team.

```bash title="terminal"
$ bun feedback "Love the new release!"
$ bun feedback report.txt details.log
$ echo "please document X" | bun feedback --email you@example.com

You can provide feedback as text arguments, file paths, or piped input.
