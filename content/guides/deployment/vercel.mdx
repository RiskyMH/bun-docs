[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform that lets you build, deploy, and scale your apps.

<Callout type="warning">
  The Bun runtime is in Beta; certain features (e.g., automatic source maps, byte-code caching, metrics on
  `node:http/https`) are not yet supported.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  `Bun.serve` is currently not supported on Vercel Functions. Use Bun with frameworks supported by Vercel, like Next.js,
  Express, Hono, or Nitro.
</Callout>

<Steps>
	<Step>

	  ### Configure Bun in vercel.json
		To enable the Bun runtime for your Functions, add a `bunVersion` field in your `vercel.json` file:

    	```json title="vercel.json"
    	{
    		"bunVersion": "1.x" // [!code ++]
    	}
    	```

    	Vercel automatically detects this configuration and runs your application on Bun. The value has to be `"1.x"`, Vercel handles the minor version internally.

    	For best results, match your local Bun version with the version used by Vercel.
    </Step>

    <Step>

      ### Next.js configuration
    	If you’re deploying a **Next.js** project (including ISR), update your `package.json` scripts to use the Bun runtime:

    	```json title="package.json"
    	{
    		"scripts": {
    			"dev": "bun --bun next dev", // [!code ++]
    			"build": "bun --bun next build" // [!code ++]
    		}
    	}
    	```

    	<Callout type="info">
    		The `--bun` flag runs the Next.js CLI under Bun. Bundling (via Turbopack or Webpack) remains unchanged, but all commands execute within the Bun runtime.
    	</Callout>

    	This ensures both local development and builds use Bun.
    </Step>

    <Step>

      ### Deploy your app
    	Connect your repository to Vercel, or deploy from the CLI:

    	```bash title="terminal"
    	# Using bunx (no global install)
    	$ bunx vercel login
    	$ bunx vercel deploy
    	```

    	Or install the Vercel CLI globally:

    	```bash title="terminal"
    	$ bun i -g vercel
    	$ vercel login
    	$ vercel deploy
    	```

    	[Learn more in the Vercel Deploy CLI documentation →](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy)
    </Step>

    <Step>

      ### Verify the runtime
    	To confirm your deployment uses Bun, log the Bun version:

    	```ts title="index.ts"
    	console.log("runtime", process.versions.bun);
    	// => runtime $BUN_LATEST_VERSION
    	```

- [Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/docs/fluid-compute): Both Bun and Node.js runtimes run on Fluid compute and support the same core Vercel Functions features.
- [Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/routing-middleware): To run Routing Middleware with Bun, set the runtime to `nodejs`:

```ts title="middleware.ts"
export const config = { runtime: "nodejs" }; // [!code ++]
```
