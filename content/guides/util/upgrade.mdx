Bun can upgrade itself using the built-in `bun upgrade` command. This is the fastest way to get the latest features and bug fixes.

```bash title="terminal"
$ bun upgrade
```

This downloads and installs the latest stable version of Bun, replacing the currently installed version.

<Callout type="info">To see the current version of Bun, run `bun --version`.</Callout>

---

## Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, verify the new version:

```bash title="terminal"
$ bun --version
Output: 1.x.y

# See the exact commit of the Bun binary
$ bun --revision
Output: 1.x.y+abc123def
```

---

## Upgrade to canary builds

Canary builds are automatically released on every commit to the `main` branch. These are untested but useful for trying new features or verifying bug fixes before they're released.

```bash title="terminal"
$ bun upgrade --canary
```

<Callout type="warning">Canary builds are not recommended for production use. They may contain bugs or breaking changes.</Callout>

---

## Switch back to stable

If you're on a canary build and want to return to the latest stable release:

```bash title="terminal"
$ bun upgrade --stable
```

---

## Install a specific version

To install a specific version of Bun, use the install script with a version tag:

<Tabs items={['macOS & Linux', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab value="macOS & Linux">
    ```bash title="terminal"
    $ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v$BUN_LATEST_VERSION"
   ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Windows">
    ```powershell title="PowerShell"
    > iex "& {$(irm https://bun.sh/install.ps1)} -Version $BUN_LATEST_VERSION"
   ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Package manager users

If you installed Bun via a package manager, use that package manager to upgrade instead of `bun upgrade` to avoid conflicts.

<Callout type="info">
**Homebrew users** <br />
To avoid conflicts with Homebrew, use `brew upgrade bun` instead.

**Scoop users** <br />
To avoid conflicts with Scoop, use `scoop update bun` instead.

</Callout>
