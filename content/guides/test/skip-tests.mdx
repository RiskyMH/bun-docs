To skip a test with the Bun test runner, use the `test.skip` function.

```ts title="test.ts"
import {test} from 'bun:test';

test.skip("unimplemented feature", () => {
  expect(Bun.isAwesome()).toBe(true);
});
```

---

Running `bun test` will not execute this test. It will be marked as skipped in the terminal output.

```sh title="terminal"
$ bun test

test.test.ts:
✓ add [0.03ms]
✓ multiply [0.02ms]
» unimplemented feature

 2 pass
 1 skip
 0 fail
 2 expect() calls
Ran 3 tests across 1 files. [74.00ms]
```
